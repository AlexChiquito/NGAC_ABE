# Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) enabled by Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE)


Here we should have some good filler text.

## Prelude
### NGAC 

NGAC is a system that allows you to perform access control based on a set of user attributes. 

### ABE
Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a system that allows you to encrypt data based on a set of user attributes.

## How do they work together?
So far, the systems do not work together, though, in theory, they could. 
That is what this project is about.  For further reading on the subject, refer to the internal documentation in the [`docs`](./docs/) directory.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
```bash
|- docs/            # Internal documentation
